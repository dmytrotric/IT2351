 We need to know the ID of the customer to be removed from the Customers table. Then we will remove the customer from the Customers table.

// deletes the lines that match the condition
   DELETE FROM Customers
// use a condition that determines which rows in the table should be deleted 
   WHERE CustomerName='customer_id'
//
